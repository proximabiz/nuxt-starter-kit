                <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set
                    out in this privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law
                    (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this policy will require us
                    keeping your personal information for longer than 1 year.</p>
                <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will
                    either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal
                    information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
                    information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
                <p>5. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</p>
                <p>In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and

                    account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you
                    become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at

                <p>In Short: In some regions, such as the European Economic Area, you have rights that allow you
                    greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or
                    terminate your account at any time.</p>
                <p>In some regions (like the European Economic Area), you have certain rights under applicable data
                    protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your
                    personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing
                    of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain
                    circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal
                    information. To make such a request, please use the contact details provided below. We will
                    consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
                <p>If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to
                    withdraw your consent at any time. Please note however that this will not affect the lawfulness
                    of the processing before its withdrawal.</p>
                <p>If you are resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we are unlawfully processing
                    your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection
                    supervisory authority. You can find their contact details here:
                    http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm.</p>
                <p>8. DATA BREACH</p>
                <p>A privacy breach occurs when there is unauthorized access to or collection, use, disclosure or
                    disposal of personal information. You will be notified about data breaches when
                    https://www.proximabiz.com believes you are likely to be at risk or serious harm. For example, a
                    data breach may be likely to result in serious financial harm or harm to your mental or physical
                    well-being. In the event that https://www.proximabiz.com becomes aware of a security breach
                    which has resulted or may result in unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal
                    information https://www.proximabiz.com will promptly investigate the matter and notify the
                    applicable Supervisory Authority not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, unless
                    the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural
                    persons.</p>
                <p>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</p>
                <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a
                    Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not
                    to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform
                    technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we
                    do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
                    communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted
                    that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version
                    of this privacy policy.</p>
                <p>10. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</p>
                <p>In Short: Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding
                    access to your personal information.</p>
                <p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine The Light” law, permits our users
                    who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge,
                    information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for
                    direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared
                    personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California
                    resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us
                    using the contact information provided below.</p>
                <p>If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with the
                    Services, you have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the
                    Services. To request removal of such data, please contact us using the contact information
                    provided below, and include the email address associated with your account and a statement that
                    you reside in California. We will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the Services,
                    but please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from our
                    systems.</p>
                <p>11. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS POLICY?</p>
                <p>In Short: Yes, we will update this policy as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.</p>
                <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an
                    updated “Revised” date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If
                    we make material changes to this privacy policy, we may notify you either by prominently posting
                    a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review
                    this privacy policy frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.</p>
