          A privacy breach occurs when there is unauthorized access to or collection, use, disclosure or
          disposal of personal information. You will be notified about data breaches when
          https://www.proximabiz.com believes you are likely to be at risk or serious harm. For example, a
          data breach may be likely to result in serious financial harm or harm to your mental or physical
          well-being. In the event that https://www.proximabiz.com becomes aware of a security breach
          which has resulted or may result in unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal
          information https://www.proximabiz.com will promptly investigate the matter and notify the
          applicable Supervisory Authority not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, unless

          to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform
          technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we
          do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
          communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted
          that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version
          of this privacy policy.
