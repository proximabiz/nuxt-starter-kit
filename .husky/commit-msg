# This script is used by Husky to validate commit messages before allowing a commit.

# Use npx to run commitlint without requiring a global installation
# `--no-install` flag ensures that `commitlint` is not installed globally and uses the local version in node_modules
# `--edit` flag tells commitlint to lint the commit message provided by the user
npx --no-install commitlint --edit
